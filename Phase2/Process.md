# Process - Aquarium
##### Team 4: Alexander Biggs, Spencer Elliott, Sze-Cheung (Ryan) Fan, Nicholas Goh, Wei-Ping (Allen) Hsiao, Peter Lu, Kyle Zhou
--------
**NOTE: No estimations for percentages of React components were made due to the fact that there was no forseeable end in mind**


##### February 9th - Post-Phase 1 Review
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Completion of Phase 1
- Reviewed design spec together
- Discussed possible experimentations in technology we want to use
- Plan to ask TA for project approval in class later today
- The role of Scrum master has been deemed more or less unecessary by the team
	- We have agreed on a mutual timing weekly both Monday and Wednesday for our "daily" scrums


##### February 11th - Sprint 1 Planning
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Project was approved
- Reviewed the Phase 2 handout in group
- Discussion of how to break off tasks:
	- Alex and Spencer will work on getting the build working (50% of MVP)
	- Peter and Kyle will setup term.js (50% of MVP)
	- Ryan, Nick and Allen will design React.js components (0% of MVP but relevant to everything after)
	- This decision was made unanimously with no objection, although understanding exactly how the three components related was quintessential to the decision
- Goal for the sprint: 
	- Continual work on the build, moving towards completion
	- Research term.js
	- Research React.js

##### February 16th - Sprint 1 review
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Work on the build has been made with several major issues being left to solve (70% done)
- No code towards term.js has been written, but all responsible have done work on learning how to use (30% done)
- Similar situation for react.js work
- Current talks of working on setting up testing, but has been delayed until build runs correctly

##### February 18th - Sprint 2 planning
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Build team says they will be able to get the build working for OS X and certain distros of linux without any major bugs
- Research is done for Term.js, will begin implementing during this sprint
- React.js research is mostly done, finishing up is important for this sprint
- Workload should be smaller for this sprint due to impending midterms
- Discussion of graphical assets such as icons as well as a paper prototype to design look of terminal

##### February 23rd - Sprint 2 Review
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Build currently works for Mac OS X and Debian-based Linux distros with minor bugs (85% done)
	- Still testing the build so not 100% complete yet
- Term.js is now working and functional (90% done)
	- Still requires testing an a work around to allow users to host natively
- React work has been limited to personal learning, no work on development code as of yet
- During the next planning session, we will evaluate how much work is left to be done for MVP and re-allocate work

##### February 25th - Sprint 3 Planning
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Build currently has several bugs to be ironed out in the this sprint
	- Less work intensive, so build team will also develop testing tools to ensure builds correctly
- Term.js work still needs to be made native, requesting help from other members of the team
	- Should be 100% complete by the end of this sprint
- React.js work should start to be done on the repository
	- Idea is that any relevant work should be put on, and can be reviewed at a later date to improve on React fundamentals

##### March 2nd - Sprint 3 Review
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Build now works 100% on Mac OS X and Debian-based linux distros with no bugs (100% done!!)
	- Possibility of extending to other distros, but for now this is sufficient
- Term.js now integrates with the NodeWebKit build and works natively with no bugs. (100% done!)
- React.js components are developed, but require polish and improvement (75% )
	- Next planning meeting will include discussion of mockup to solidify design idea 
- Our Minimum Viable Product for Phase 2 is now more or less complete with room for polish left

##### March 4th - Sprint 4 Planning
Location: _Bahen Laptop Lab_

- Build will be extended to support RPM-based distros such as Fedora due to members using said distro
- Testing tools are completed and are to be run on each OS to make sure it builds properly
- Mockup work has been done and members are all sharing similar ideas for work
- Basic React component templates need to be added to the feature/sidebar branch
- Documentation needs to be completed for Phase 2

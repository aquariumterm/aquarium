## Other tools

#### [Slack](https://slack.com/)

Our team uses Slack to communicate via text and to receive notifications from GitHub
and CircleCI when people make commits, create and comment on issues, and when tests pass/fail.

#### [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team4-repo)

We use CircleCI to automatically run tests and build distributable binaries whenever
commits are pushed to GitHub.

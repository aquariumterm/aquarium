--------------
Based on the initial scope we had for Phase 2, we have designed a working terminal emulator that allows a user to download and run a wrapper for their system terminal natively. Our build currently works for **Mac OS X**, **Debian-based Linux distributions** as well as some **RPM-based distributions** such as _Fedora_. All installation and setup information is documented in the [README](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team4-repo/blob/master/README.md).

In addition to the functioning Terminal we have also began implementation of additional ease-of-use features such as the documentation, and currently have infrastructure in-place such that once we have data parsing connected, we will be able to generate entries for the documentation dynamically. These mockups and the relevant code can be viewed in the [`feature/sidebar`](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team4-repo/tree/feature/sidebar) branch of our repository.

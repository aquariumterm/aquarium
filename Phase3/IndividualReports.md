- My most significant contribution to the project was the design and implementation of the [base Terminal.js](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team4-repo/pull/13) component, as well as the implmentation of the [parsed TL;DR pages](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team4-repo/issues/29) for use in the sidebar component. 

- During our work on Aquarium, I've learned the importance of continual tests, as well as the difficulties in dealing with different version of software such as node-webkit. [#14](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team4-repo/issues/14)

- My main strengths as a team member is my ability to spot mistakes or improvements of work done by others. During the implementation of [Terminal.js](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team4-repo/pull/13), I successfully peer-reviewed code that wasn't working for some time, and after carefully reading through it, I was able to spot the error and helped correct the mistake to allow the team to move forward.

- My main weaknesses as a team member is a relative lack of knowledge with the technologies that we were mainly using, mainly node.js and the flux architecture. I should have studied how these technologies worked during the planning stages of our project, as my inexperienced slowed down the team in our implementation of certain features early on.

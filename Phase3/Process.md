Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.
-------------------------------

For our team, we had some stronger and some weaker programmers.  Something that we came up with was a half-day hackathon where the stronger programmers will help keep the team up to date with how all the code works, whiche allowed the team work more efficiently during the weekend.
  Two meetings per week allowed our team to keep on track what needed to get done, what took longer than usual and what got done.  Because we were always aware of the groups progress, it was much easier to assign tasks to team members.

Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.
-------------------------------
Our group decided to switch between technologies, or add new technologies and this required a very steep learning curve form the weaker programmers.  Because of the changes, there needed to be more time for everyone to learn how to use the new technologies.  Althought sometimes changing technologies can possbily make work more difficult, in our case, it made it easier.


If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?
-------------------------------
  
As a team, it may be more useful to include days such as our half-day hackathon, where the stronger programmers teach the weaker programmers so that they can be more productive their time.  Especially near the beginning of middle of the project where the basics of the program are done, and we need to add features to the project that are extended from previously written code.

index.html is client
term.js is server

TODO: 
 - convert server into standalone module (running instance of terminal)
 - convert that into a react component
 - ???
 - Profit.

get it to compile on linux x_x

do testing to make sure we don't break anything


Breaking down server
================
 - remove all express components
 - remove all socket.io stuff
 - change so that it takes in input from stdin instead of socket
 - make sure that when run the resultant terminal it acts like normal bash terminal

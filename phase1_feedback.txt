1. Need to do weekly logs + peer evals
2. Look at breaking up the projects into high effort, low
marks and low effort, high marks
3. User stories:
    -- need to include priority, size, difficulty
    -- numerical ranks would be good
4. MVP was fine, but watch out for grammar errors
5. Release + iteration planning, missed out on the details of
what we're looking for in the first phase.
